""" 
example of an actual array in C language

char str[] = "apple"; - The size of the array was establish, but the elements inside of it can be edited. 
ex:
str[0] = "A" will result in Apple instead of apple

or 

const char* thislist[] = {"apple", "banana", "cherry", "strawberry"};

The array of strings is actually a bunch of char arrays indicating the start of the string
